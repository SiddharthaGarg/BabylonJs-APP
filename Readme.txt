At a given time you can choose one mode only ( draw , move, extrude, play with vertices). Click on the gui buttons to select the mode. By default no mode is selected

DRAW MODE -  Left-click on the ground plane where you want the vertices of desired polygon. They will be highlighted by a small sphere.
             Righ-t click once you have selected all the points, and then a 2d polygon would be created. 


EXTRUDE MODE - Just Click on the Extrude Meshes button and all the 2d shapes lying on ground plane will turn into solid with a height 40.

MOVE MODE - Left-click the object that you want to move. It will be highlighted and then you can drag it along the ground to move it. 

PLAY WITH VERTICES MODE - When you hover over the object , it is highlighted and as soon as you reach very close proximity of any vertex, it is highlighted with a small sphere.
                    You can now easily drag the vertex along three axes of position gizmos and upon releasing it would be updated.
